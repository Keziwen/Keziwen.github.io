collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-01-SPM-Review
excerpt: 'This article provides an overview of deep-learning-based image reconstruction methods for MRI. Two types of deep-learningbased approaches are reviewed, those that are based on unrolled algorithms and those that are not, and the main structures of both are explained. Several signal processing issues for maximizing the potential of deep reconstruction in fast MRI are discussed, which may facilitate further development of the networks and performance analysis from a theoretical point of view.'
