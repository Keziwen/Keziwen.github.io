This paper proposes a dynamic MR imaging method with both k-space and spatial prior knowledge integrated via multi-supervised
network training, dubbed as DIMENSION. Specifically, the DIMENSION architecture consists of a frequential prior network for updating the k-space with its network prediction and a spatial prior network for capturing image structures and details. Furthermore, a multi-supervised network training technique is developed to constrain the frequency domain information and the spatial domain information.
