title: "DIMENSION: Dynamic MR imaging with both k-space and
spatial prior knowledge obtained via multi-supervised network
training"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-paper-DIMENSION
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a dynamic MR imaging method with both k-space and spatial prior knowledge integrated via multi-supervised
network training, dubbed as DIMENSION. Specifically, the DIMENSION architecture consists of a frequential prior network for updating the k-space with its network prediction and a spatial prior network for capturing image structures and details. Furthermore, a multi-supervised network training technique is developed to constrain the frequency domain information and the spatial domain information.'
