collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-12-optical
excerpt: ' In this paper, we present a deep‐learning‐based deblurring method that is fast and applicable to optical microscopic imaging systems. We tested the robustness of proposed deblurring method on the publicly available data, simulated data and experimental data (including 2D optical microscopic data and 3D photoacoustic microscopic data), which all showed much improved deblurred results compared to deconvolution..'
